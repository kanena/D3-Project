		<h2> Step 1: Setting up and using a Web Server </h2>
			<p> Having a web server was an important part of this project. Without a local or online server, the XMLHttpRequest used to load our csv file 
			could not processed within a browser </p>
			<p> The server we used was Namecheap. We had hosting plan that allowed us to use a registered domain. I chose a domain I used for one of my test projects,
			and set the directory to a non-visible link: <a href="http://www.akpsight.site/Z-d3/">http://www.akpsight.site/Z-d3/</a>. Here, I stored each graph into different
			folders labeled G[n]. Each folder contained a CSV file that contained our data and an HTML file which turned that data into a visualization. 
			</p><p>Keeping each graph in a different folder directory made debugging much simpler. Combining the graphs at the end of this project created issues due to referencing 
			different versions of D3.js (discussed more later), so gradually adding all the graphs to one page would create too many problems to diagnose/test at one time. Once 
			the general structure of folder directories was set up, keeping track of files and their functions was very simple.
		</p><h2> Step 2: Applying HTML and CSS formatting </h2>
			<p> Using HTML and CSS was an interesting part of our project. With each graph separated by folder, there was not much CSS to worry about initially. We added &lt;head&gt; tag 
			sections to store Javascript APIs such as D3, dimple, a d3.tip extension, and jQuery. All content was stored in a div that creating padding; that way, words were not
			too close to the edge of the web page. Our &lt;h1&gt; tag stored the title of dashboard in white with a blue background, while &lt;h2&gt; tags were titles for each graph.
			The &lt;div&gt; tags within our content were used for each graph, which was created through javascript. One of our graph uses &lt;select&gt; and &lt;option&gt; tags to
			filter different values within the CSV file, and we are planning to add this to our "Impact Of Shooting On Star" graph within the 2nd project submission. </p>
			<p> We used CSS to format clickable &lt;a&gt; tags into blue buttons that changed color when someone hovered over it. This created navigation between the different pages
			of our project. It also was used for one of our graphs to change the color of the bars and the default formatting features within the D3.js API </p>
		<h2> Step 3: Gathering and Integrating Data </h2>
			<p>The data for the first graph came from basketball reference and was copied and pasted into word.  The page was 
			<a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats.html"> http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats.html </a>
			and included the league averages for every major stat in each season.  I put the data in csv file and deleted all the years before 1979 because the NBA did not have a three point shot
			before this year. I then cut down the different stat categories to only include 3 point field goal attempts and makes to see how they changed throughout the years.
			</p><p>The data from the second graph also came from basketball reference but I had to go each team's individual page for the 2015-2016 season. From there I copied and pasted each teams
			wins, 3 point field goal percentage, and 3 point attempts per game into a csv file. </p>
			<p> To get the data for the third graph, the first thing I did I had to do was determine who each
			team best player and best 3 point shooter was. To do this I looked at this season's data for every team from basketball reference.  I used total points scored over the season to
 			pick every team's best player, and I used a combination of 3 point percentage and total 3 point makes to pick every team's best 3 point shooter.  I took note of every instance where
			the team's best player was also their best 3 point shooter. When this happened I chose the player with the second most 3 point makes as the best shooter.  When I had these 60
			players I went to stats.nba.com/impact to see how the best player fared with and without the best shooter on the court.  For every team I copied and pasted the best player's stats
			when the top 3 point shooter was on the court and when they were off the court into an csv file. </p>
		<h2> Step 4: Utilizing D3.js within the dimple.js API </h2>
			<p> Using D3.js was probably the most challenging part of this project. For our graph that did not use the dimple.js extension, we set the xAxis and yAxis with the
			d3.scale.ordinal() and d3.scale.linear() commands, setting the range dependent on the width we wanted the graph to take up. The d3.tip() function was an API extension of D3.js
			which allowed us to display a pop-up box displaying specific stats, depending on the values specified within our &lt;select&gt; tag. After these variables were set, we appended
			the svg to our &lt;div&gt; containing the id of the graph, setting the width, height, and position of the graph. svg.call([tip object]) allowed us to incorporate the d3.tip API
			into our graph.</p> 
			<p> d3.csv imported all of our data from the CSV file into the svg object, which contained properties values set as we just described. We set the domain of x to include team names
			placed within the &lt;select&gt; tag. The y domain range was from 0 to the maximum value from the selected stat; if the stat included percentages, the max was set at 1.
			svg.append("g") was used to set the label values located on the x-axis and y-axis. The svg.selectAll(".bar") set the heights of the bars for each player's stat, and performed
			calculations to grab the right x-axis and y-axis values. .on('mouseover', tip.show) let us show the pop-up box, displaying relevant statistics for interpreting the graph. </p>
			<p> Making graphs using dimple.js functions was much simpler to do. dimple.newSvg("#Graph1", 600, 600) creates a new svg container that has the width, height, and the id the
			new svg is being imported into. Using d3.csv([file location], function(data)), we then make assign a graph to a variable using dimple.chart(svg, data). We append data attributes
			to this new chart object using myChart.addCategoryAxis("x", [name]) and var myAxisY = myChart.addMeasureAxis("y", [name]); "name" represents any column of data you want to represent
			from the CSV data. Various formating goals were obtained by going online and looking at dimple.js documentation, which allowed us to edit information such as chart titles, axis
			labels, min/max values for any axis. myChart.addSeries([name], dimple.plot.[chart type]) allowed us set which groups were going to be compared on the graph, and what chart-type
			would be displayed. Our chart types were a line, bubble, and bar chart, sometimes using multiple category names and measure axis to show different views of data. </p>
		<h2> Step 5: Utilizing jQuery to create the D3.js graphs </h2>
			<p>jQuery helped us load our graphs into the page. After clicking on different filter options, someone can then click the button "Make Chart" to load his results. We assigned
			the function name "filterChart()" to load values from &lt;select&gt; tags, targeting its id name and using the $("#chart1a").val() command. After reading these lines, our 
			makeChart(teamName, statType) function took in these 2 &lt;select&gt; values, recreating the graph to display the correct specified stats 
		</p><h2> Continual Work: Getting and formatting data </h2>
			<p> Throughout this project, we looked at what types of insights we could provide and create through our visualizations. We were able to grab data from multiple source online, and
			reformatted the CVS files to contain parameter names and values that allowed us to render our graphs with meaningful insights </p>
